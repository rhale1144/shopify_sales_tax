# shopify_sales_tax

This a short script I created to quickly calculate sales tax for a Shopify orders export for payment to the State. Currently it is only set up for Virginia because that is all I need. It is not perfect, but it 100% beats paying $99 a month or whatever it is to use TaxJar. Just an example of how I can use my scripting knowledge to solve a real world problem with real financial impact.
